TypeScript is definitely the best thing that happened to JavaScript. period.

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about "The best thing that happened to Java/C# devs writing JavaScript with it üëÄüò≥üåÄ‚è±"

Why ü§®?

Well, it definitely makes your Java/C# ego feel like at home, having types within JavaScript (which is amazing !), but then it introduces other "language features" which are not part of standard JavaScript, and because of those, it may throw a false prejudice about TypeScript, by putting it to a "Completely new language" bag, which isn't really true IMHO.

I've been always trying to stay away from various TS features (for a good reasons btw.) to stay in Idiomatic/Standard JavaScript space as much as possible.

This article describes various patterns/tips that I "invented/learned" and have been using while using TypeScript and React for building UI's.

> Initially, this blog post introduced "only" 10 tips, I may add additional ones in the future. Definitely check this post time to time for any updates üòé

Whole article is written in a "Style guide style" with 3 sub-categories for every tip/pattern which consists of:

- **Don't** ( code example what you shouldn't be doing)
- **Do** or **Good/Better** (code example what you should be doing)
- **Why** (reasoning/explanation)

With that covered, let's hop into 10 TypeScript Pro tips/patterns with ( or without ) React.

---

## 1. Don't use `public` accessor within classes

**Don't:**

```tsx
class App extends Component {
  public handleChange() {}
  public render() {
    return <div>Hello</div>
  }
}
```

![public accessor - Don't](./img/01-dont.png)

**Do:**

```tsx
class App extends Component {
  handleChange() {}
  render() {
    return <div>Hello</div>
  }
}
```

![public accessor - Do](./img/01-do.png)

**Why?**

All members within class are `public` by default (and always public in runtime, TS private/protected will "hide" particular class properties/methods only during compile time). Don't introduce extra churn to your codebase. Also using `public` accessor is not "valid/idiomatic javascript"

## 2. Don't use `private` accessor within Component class

**Don't:**

```tsx
class App extends Component {
  private handleChange = (ev: import('react').ChangeEvent) => {}
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input onChange={this.handleChange} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

![private accessor - Don't](./img/02-dont.png)

**Good:**

```tsx
class App extends Component {
  _handleChange = (ev: import('react').ChangeEvent) => {}
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input onChange={this._handleChange} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

![private accessor - Good](./img/02-good.png)

**Better:**

```tsx
const handleChange = Symbol()

class App extends Component {
  // private property via symbol
  [handleChange] = (ev: import('react').ChangeEvent) => {}

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/*private property access via symbol ref with proper type safety*/}
        <input onChange={this[handleChange]} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

![private accessor - Better](./img/02-better.png)

**Why:**

`private` accessor won't make your properties/methods on class private during runtime. It's just TypeScript "emulation during compile time". Don't get fooled and make things "private" by using well known patterns like:

- name starting with underscore üëâ `_someProp`
- or if you really wanna make those properties private use `Symbol` for defining those. ( [real runtime private properties are coming to ECMAscript](https://github.com/bloomberg/TypeScript/pull/6) )

In reality, you should almost never need to work directly with React Component instance nor accessing its class properties.

## 3. Don't use `protected` accessor within Component class

**Don't**

```tsx
type BaseProps = { config: object; who: string }

class Base extends Component<BaseProps> {
  protected renderInnerContent(config: BaseProps['config']) {
    return (
      <>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(config)}</pre>
      </>
    )
  }
}

class SomeFeature extends Base {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.renderInnerContent(this.props)}</div>
  }
}
```

![protected accessor - Don't](./img/03-dont.png)

**Do**

```tsx
class InnerContent extends Component<{ config: object }> {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(this.props.config)}</pre>
      </>
    )
  }
}

type Props = { who: string } & InnerContent['props']
class SomeFeature extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <InnerContent config={this.props.config} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

![protected accessor - Do](./img/03-do.png)

**Why:**

Using `protected` is an immediate "RED ALERT" üö®üö®üö® in terms of functional patterns leverage with React. There are more effective patterns like this for extending behaviour of some component. You can use:

- just extract the logic to separate component and use it as seen above
- **HoC** (high order function) and **functional composition**.
- **CaaF** ( children as a function )

## 4. Don't use `enum`

**Don't:**

```tsx
enum Response {
  No,
  Yes,
}

function respond(recipient: string, message: Response): void {
  // ...
}

enum Colors {
  Red = 'RED',
  Green = 'GREEN',
  Blue = 'BLUE',
}

function favoriteColor(name: string, color: Colors) {
  // ...
}
```

![enum - Dont](./img/04-dont.png)

**Good:**

If you need to support runtime enums use following pattern:

```tsx
type EnumLiteralsOf<T extends object> = T[keyof T]

// merge implementation with "Enum" typed literal
// $ExpectType 1 | 2
export type Response = EnumLiteralsOf<typeof Response>
// $ExpectType Readonly<{ No: 1; Yes: 2; }>
export const Response = Object.freeze({
  // we need to explicit cast values to get proper literal type
  No: 1 as 1,
  Yes: 2 as 2,
})

function respond(recipient: string, message: Response) {
  // ...
}

// merge implementation with "Enum" typed literal
// $ExpectType "RED" | "GREEN" | "BLUE"
export type Colors = EnumLiteralsOf<typeof Colors>
// $ExpectType Readonly<{ Red: "RED"; Green: "GREEN"; Blue: "BLUE"; }>
export const Colors = Object.freeze({
  Red: 'RED' as 'RED',
  Green: 'GREEN' as 'GREEN',
  Blue: 'BLUE' as 'BLUE',
})

function favoriteColor(name: string, color: Colors) {
  // ...
}
```

![enum - Good](./img/04-good.png)

**Better:**

If you don't need to support runtime enums, all you need to use are type literals:

```tsx
type Response = 1 | 2

function respond(recipient: string, message: Response) {
  // ...
}

type Colors = 'RED' | 'GREEN' | 'BLUE'

function favoriteColor(name: string, color: Colors) {
  // ...
}
```

![enum - Better](./img/04-better.png)

**Why?**

To use `enum` within TypeScript might be very tempting, especially if you're coming from language like C# or Java. But there are better ways how to interpret both with well known JS idiomatic patterns or as can be seen in "Better" example just by using compile time **type literals**.

- Enums compiled output generates unnecessary boilerplate (which can be mitigated with `const enum` though. Also string enums are better in this one)
  - ![enum - generated js](./img/04-js-output.png)
- Non string Enums don't narrow to proper number type literal, which can introduce unhandled bug within your app
  - ![enum - missing errors](./img/04-test-cases-comparison.png)
- It's not standard/idiomatic JavaScript (although `enum` is reserved word in ECMA standard)

### Enum helper

In our "Good" example, you might think like, ugh that's a lot of boilerplate dude! I hear you my friends. Loud and clear üôè

If you need to support runtime enums for various reasons, you can leverage small utility function from [rex-tils library](https://github.com/Hotell/rex-tils) like showcased here:

```tsx
import { Enum } from '@martin_hotell/rex-tils'

// merge implementation with "Enum" typed literal
// $ExpectType 'No' | 'Yes'
export type Response = Enum<typeof Response>
// $ExpectType Readonly<{ No: 'No'; Yes: 'Yes'; }>
export const Response = Enum('No', 'Yes')

function respond(recipient: string, message: Response) {
  // ...
}

// merge implementation with "Enum" typed literal
// $ExpectType "Red" | "Green" | "Blue"
export type Colors = Enum<typeof Colors>
// $ExpectType Readonly<{ Red: "Red"; Green: "Green"; Blue: "Blue"; }>
export const Colors = Enum('RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE')

function favoriteColor(name: string, color: Colors) {
  // ...
}
```

![enum - Good with rex-tils Enum helper](./img/04-good-with-rex-tils.png)

## 5. Don't use `constructor` for class Components

**Don't:**

```tsx
type State = { count: 0 }
type Props = {}

class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    // if you'll forget to call the super class constructor
    // bad things start to happen üö®üí•
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    }
  }
}
```

![constructor - Don't](./img/05-dont.png)

**Do:**

```tsx
type State = { count: number }
type Props = {}

class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  }
}
```

![constructor - Do](./img/05-do.png)

**Why:**

There is really no need to use constructor within React Component.

If you do so, you need to provide more code boilerplate and also need to call `super` with provided props ( if you forget to pass props to your super, your component will contain bugs as props will not be propagated correctly).

> But... but... hey ! React official docs use constructor!
> üëâ That's fine (React team uses current version of JS to showcase stuff)
>
> But... but..., class properties are not standard JavaScript!
> üëâ Class fields are in [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#consensus-in-tc39), which means they are gonna be implemented in JS soon

### Initializing state with some logic

Of course you may ask, what if I need to introduce some logic to initialize component state, or even to initialize the state from some dependant values, like props for example.

Answer to your question is rather straightforward.

Just define a pure function outside the component with your custom logic (as a "side effect" you'll get easily tested code as well üëå).

```tsx
type State = { counter: number }
type Props = { initialCount: number }

const getInitialState = (props: Props): State => {
  /*some logic here*/ return {
    /*demanded object*/
  }
}

class App extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = getInitialState(this.props)
}
```

![constructor - with complex logic](./img/05-get-initial-state.png)

## 6. Don't use decorators for class Components

**Don't:**

```tsx
@connect(mapStateToProps)
export class Container extends Component {}
```

![decorators - Don't](./img/06-dont.png)

**Good:**

```tsx
const enhance = connect(mapStateToProps)

class Container extends Component {}

export default enhance(Container)
```

![decorators - Good](./img/06-good.png)

**Better:**

```tsx
import { compose } from 'redux'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { translate } from 'react-i18n'

const enhance = compose(
  translate(),
  connect(mapStateToProps)
  // add as many HoC as you need. Functional composition FTW üëå
)

class Container extends Component {}

export default enhance(Container)
```

![decorators - Better](./img/06-better.png)

**Why:**

Decorators are parasitic üêõ üëÄ ü§¢

- You won't be able to get original/clean version of your class.
- TypeScript uses old version of decorator proposal which isn't gonna be implemented in ECMAscript standard üö®.
- It adds additional runtime code and processing time execution to your app.
- What is most important though, in terms of type checking within JSX, is, that decorators don't extend class type definition. That means (in our example), that our Container component, will have absolutely no type information for consumer about added/removed props.

## 7. Use _lookup types_ for accessing component State/Props types

> [lookup types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-1.html#keyof-and-lookup-types)

**Don't:**

```tsx
// counter.tsx
export type State = { counter: number }
export type Props = { someProps: string }

export class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  /*...some code*/
}

// consumer.tsx
import { Props, Counter } from './counter'
type SomeType = Props & {
  /* ... */
}

class Consumer extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Counter />
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

![props and state types as public API - Don't](./img/07-dont.png)

**Do:**

```tsx
// counter.tsx
type State = { counter: number }
type Props = { someProps: string }

export class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  /*...some code*/
}

// consumer.tsx

// CLEANER API
import { Counter } from './counter'

// üôá‚Äç USE LOOKUP TYPE
type SomeType = Counter['props'] & {
  /*...*/
}

class Consumer extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Counter />
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

![props and state types as public API - Do](./img/07-do.png)

**Why:**

- Exporting Props or State from your component implementation is making your API surface bigger.
- You should always ask a question, why consumers of your component should be able to import explicit State/Props type? If they really need that, they can always access it via type lookup functionality. So cleaner API but type information is still there for everyone. Win Win üí™
- If you need to provide a complex Props type though, it should be extracted to `models/types` file exported as Public API.

## 8. Always provide explicit type for `children` Props

**Don't:**

```tsx
// button.tsx

import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    const { children } = this.props

    return <button>{children}</button>
  }
}

// user-detail.tsx

type Props = { id: string; name: string; email: string }
class UserDetail extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    const { id, email, name } = this.props
    return (
      <section>
        <h3>
          {name} : {id}
        </h3>
        <p>Email : {email}</p>
      </section>
    )
  }
}

// app.tsx

const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Button>click</Button>
    <Button />
    <UserDetail id="421312" email="johnny@five.org" name="Johnny the Fifth" />
    <UserDetail id="421312" email="johnny@five.org" name="Johnny the Fifth">
      Who am I?
    </UserDetail>
  </main>
)
```

![Explicit children type - Don't](./img/08-dont.png)

**Do:**

```tsx
// button.tsx

type Props = {
  children: children: import('react').ReactNode
}
class Button extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    const { children } = this.props

    return <button>{children}</button>
  }
}

// user-detail.tsx

type Props = { id: string; name: string; email: string; children?: never }

class UserDetail extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    const { id, email, name } = this.props
    return (
      <section>
        <h3>
          {name} : {id}
        </h3>
        <p>Email : {email}</p>
      </section>
    )
  }
}

// app.tsx

import {Button} from './button'
import {UserDetail} from './user-detail'

const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Button>click</Button>
    {/* $ExpectError üëâ Button needs to have children */}
    <Button />
    <UserDetail id="421312" email="johnny@five.org" name="Johnny the Fifth" />
    {/* $ExpectError üëâ  UserDetail cannot use children */}
    <UserDetail id="421312" email="johnny@five.org" name="Johnny the Fifth">
      Who am I?
    </UserDetail>
  </main>
)
```

![Explicit children type - Do](./img/08-do.png)

**Why:**

- `children` prop is annotated as optional within both Component and Functional Component in `react.d.ts` which just mirrors the implementation how React handles children.
  While that's ok and everything, I prefer to be explicit with component API.

- if you plan to use `children` for content projection, make sure to explicit annotate it with type of your choosing and in opposite, if your component doesn't use it, prevent it's usage with `never` type.

### Children type constraint

> Hey, mister Skateboarder ! I have a question ‚úã:

What types can be used for `children` annotation in TypeScript ? I mean, can I constraint children to be only a particular type of Component ([like is possible with Flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/children/#toc-only-allowing-a-specific-element-type-as-children)) ? Something like `Tab` within `Tabs` `children: Tab[]` ?

Unfortunately not üôÉ, as TypeScript isn't able to "parse" output of `JSX.factory` üëâ `React.createElement` which returns `JSX.Element` from global namespace, which `extends React.ReactElement<any>` so what compiler gets is an object type, with type checking turned off (WARNING:every time you `any` a kitten dies üôÄüòÖ)

Or as stated in TypeScript docs:

> _"By default the result of a JSX expression is typed as `any`. You can customize the type by specifying the JSX.Element interface. However, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface. **It is a black box** ‚¨õÔ∏è üì¶."_

> NOTE: TS 2.8 introduced [locally scoped JSX namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#locally-scoped-jsx-namespaces), which may help to resolve this feature in the future. Watch this space!

We can use following types for annotating `children``:

- `ReactNode` | `ReactChild` | `ReactElement`
- `Array<ReactNode>` | `Array<ReactChild>` | `Array<ReactElement>`
- `object` | `{[key:string]:unknown}` | `MyModel`
- `Array<T>`
- primitives `string` | `number` | `boolean`
- `never` | `null` | `undefined` ( null and undefined doesn't make much sense though )

## 9. Use type inference for defining Component State or DefaultProps

**Don't:**

```tsx
type State = { count: number }
type Props = { someProps: string } & DefaultProps
type DefaultProps = { who: string }

export class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  static defaultProps: DefaultProps = { who: 'Johnny 5' }
  state = {
    count: 0,
  }
}
```

![define types from implementation by leveraging inference - Don't](./img/09-dont.png)

**Good:**

```tsx
// $ExpectType { count: number; }
type State = typeof initialState
// $ExpectType { someProps: string; } & { who: string; }
type Props = { someProps: string } & typeof defaultProps

const initialState = { count: 0 }
const defaultProps = { who: 'Johnny 5' }

export class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  static defaultProps = defaultProps
  state = initialState
}
```

![define types from implementation by leveraging inference - Good](./img/09-good.png)

**Better:**

By making freezing initialState/defaultProps, type system will infer correct `readonly` types (when someone would accidentally set some value, he would get compile error). Also marking both `static defaultProps` and `state` as `readonly` within the class, is a nice touch, to prevent us from making any runtime errors when incorrectly setting state via `this.state = {...}`

```tsx
// $ExpectType Readonly<{ count: number; }>
type State = typeof initialState
// $ExpectType { someProps: string; } & Readonly<{ who: string; }>
type Props = { someProps: string } & typeof defaultProps

const initialState = Object.freeze({ count: 0 })
const defaultProps = Object.freeze({ who: 'Johnny 5' })

export class Counter extends Component<Props, State> {
  static readonly defaultProps = defaultProps
  readonly state = initialState
}
```

![define types from implementation by leveraging inference - Better](./img/09-better.png)

**Why:**

- Type information is always synced with implementation as source of truth is only one thing üëâ THE IMPLEMENTATION! üíô
- Less type boilerplate
- More readable code
- by adding readonly modifier and freezing the object, any mutation within your component will immediately end with compile error, which will prevent any runtime error = happy consumers of your app!

### What if I wanna use more complicated type within state or default props?

Use `as` operator to cast your properties within the constant.

Example:

```tsx
import { Todo } from './models'

// $ExpectType Readonly<{ todos: Todo[] | null; }>
type State = typeof initialState

const initialState = Object.freeze({ todos: null as null | Todo[] })
```

![define types from implementation by leveraging inference with complex types - Better](./img/09-better-complex-types.png)

## 10. When using factories instead of classes for models, leverage declaration merging by exporting both type and implementation

**Don't:**

```tsx
// models.ts

export const Todo = (description: string) => ({
  id: String(Date.now()),
  done: false,
  description,
})

// consumer.ts

// Todo is only factory
import { Todo } from './models'
// we need to manually create Todo interface to be able to reference it
interface TodoModel extends ReturnType<typeof Todo> {}

const initialState = Object.freeze({ todos: null as null | TodoModel[] })

class App extends Component<{}, State> {
  readonly state = initialState
  handleTodoCreation = (description: string) => {
    const newTodo = Todo(description)
    // update state etc
  }
}
```

![export both factory and type as one token when defining models - Don't](./img/10-dont.png)

**Do:**

```tsx
// models.ts

export const Todo = (description: string) => ({
  id: String(Date.now()),
  done: false,
  description,
})

export interface Todo extends ReturnType<typeof Todo> {}

// =======================================================

// consumer.ts

// Todo is both factory and type
import { Todo } from './models'

const initialState = Object.freeze({
  // 1. Todo used as type
  todos: null as null | Todo[],
})

class App extends Component<{}, State> {
  readonly state = initialState
  handleTodoCreation = (description: string) => {
    // 2. Todo used as factory
    const newTodo = Todo(description)
    // update state etc
  }
}
```

![export both factory and type as one token when defining models - Do](./img/10-do.png)

**Why:**

- Less Boilerplate
- One token for both type and implementation / Smaller API
- Both type and implementation are in sync and most importantly, implementation is the source of truth
